# Converting MD containing emojis to PDF

Markdown to PDF conversion is quite easy using `pandoc`.
The real problem arises when trying to use unicode emojis.
These emojis are becoming a real standard right now,
and they are also useful, since not only faces and hands
are represented, but also, as one can see below, they
can represent common concepts such as packages, folders
and files.

However useful it is, it's quite difficult to convert
a markdown file containing emoji characters. You must
setup special fonts, overcome lack of support by the
latex engines, only to have black-and-white emojis.

The Pandoc Emoji Filter present in this repository solves
all of these problems: it provides colored emojis by using
known emoji SVG repositories such as `twemoji` and `noto-emoji`.
Some TeX knowledge might be useful though, since there is
a `template.tex` file needed to insert SVG images in some
contexts, such as code blocks.

## Features

- Emojis can be used in normal text, like this :apple:, or like the following:

    ðŸ“¦package \
    â”£ ðŸ“‚dir1 \
    â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚subdir \
    â”— ðŸ“œfile1

- Codeblocks and Code can be used, like in `ðŸ“‚dir1`, or the following code block:

    - even if it is inside a subitem

          ðŸ“¦package
          â”£ ðŸ“‚dir1
          â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚subdir
          â”— ðŸ“œfile1

    This requires some messing with latex code, because some packages
    must be used. Specifically in this case, `fvextra` provides a
    `Verbatim` environment that allows the inclusion of inner commands,
    needed to display the image of the emoji. Thats why a `template.tex`
    must be provided to Pandoc.

- Literal emojis like `:name:` are not converted by this filter... but Pandoc can handle this.
    Use `--from markdown+emoji` or `--from gfm`, and also the Pandoc Emoji Filter to get
    these converted to PDF.

    See [Non-pandoc extensions - Pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#non-pandoc-extensions)

## Limitations

- Pre/Code tags are ignored by Pandoc when converting to PDF.
    This filter is not supposed to do anything about this,
    so I won't be doing anything here about it.

    The following code block uses `<pre>...</pre>` tags.
    They will not be rendered in the PDF, but are visible in the
    markdown visualization.

    <pre>
    ðŸ“¦package \
    â”£ ðŸ“‚dir1 \
    â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚subdir \
    â”— ðŸ“œfile1
    </pre>

    There should be a code block above... if you are looking at the [example.pdf](example.pdf),
    you'll see nothing above.

## Compiling a PDF from this `readme.md` file

In this project, I experimented with multiple ways to
do what I wanted. First, I tried with Javascript emoji
converter + Python Pandoc filter. Then, I discovered
that Pandoc filters could be made in Javascript,
using NodeJs, and made a completely JS solution.

Use the NodeJS solution instead of the Python as
it is the one I am currently developing more actively.

## Javascript + Python filter

    node app.js
    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o out.pdf output.md \
        --filter=svg_filter.py

## Javascript only filter via NodeJs

First, install JS script dependencies using npm:

    npm install

Then, run `pandoc` passing in the filter file name:

    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o out.pdf readme.md \
        --filter=emoji_filter.js

Passing parameters:

    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o out.pdf readme.md \
        --filter=emoji_filter.js -M __debug=1 -M emoji=twemoji

Debugging using VSCode:

    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o out.pdf readme.md \
        --filter=emoji_filter.js -M __debug=1

Then, in VSCode, attach to Node process... the JS filter code will be waiting,
and will only continue execution after the debugger is attached. If you don't attach
the debugger, then it will stall in an infinite loop.

## Example: compiling this `readme.md`

This `readme.md` file was compiled using the following command:

    pandoc --template="template.tex" -o example.pdf readme.md \
        --filter=emoji_filter.js -M emoji=noto-emoji --from gfm

This is the resulting PDF: [example.pdf](example.pdf)

You can also run `create-example.sh`.

## Filter parameters

Parameters are passed to the filter in the form of metadata.
Pandoc receives metadata using the `--metadata` or `-M` keywords.
Also, metadata can be specified inside markdown files, or YAML
files via `--metadata-file`. See [Pandoc's manual - Metadata Blocks](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks)
for more info.

### __debug

This is used to debug the filter using NodeJS inspector.
VSCode can debug NodeJS instances, even the ones that started
without debug parameters, via `SIGUSR1` signal.

The problem the this flag solves it that the filter
execution must wait for the debugger to be attached,
otherwise it finished before the user has the opportunity
to debug the code.

Usage: pass `-M __debug=1` to pandoc along with other params.

### emoji

This is used to select the emoji source.
At this moment only two sources are available:

- `twemoji`: [Twemoji by Twitter](https://twemoji.twitter.com/)
- `noto-emoji`: [Noto Color Emoji by Google](https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/)

Usage: pass `-M emoji=noto-emoji` or `-M emoji=twemoji` to pandoc along with other params.

See [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) for a list of emojis.

## Changing emoji cache directory

Just set the environment variable `SVG_FILTER_CACHE_DIR`.

You may need to use `declare -x SVG_FILTER_CACHE_DIR` in your script,
so that the filter can see the environment variable.
